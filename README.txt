IT3104 Software Development Deadly Sins Exercise
Name: Wapa√±o Jade A.
The three sins that I have addressed in the code are the following:

1. No magic input - Since it is just a simple registration form, no magic/hidden inputs are used in the code.
2. Using Http Only & Secure.
3. Implemented encryption on password.
4. Using proper data types and user inputs fields such as (First Name, Last Name, Email, Address, Phone Number, and Password) are setted to "required" in order to not miss a text field.
